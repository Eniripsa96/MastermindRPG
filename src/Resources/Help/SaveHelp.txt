 -= Saving Help Menu =-

How to save:
 - Saving is done automatically each time you quit the game
 - This includes using the Escape key and using 'Save & Quit
            from the game menu
 - If you lost a battle, you may not load the save file the
          next time you play.

What saves?
 - Saving does not keep quests, so do them before you quit
		  or pick them up again after you start back up
 - Your absolute position is not saved, so saving towards
		  the end of an area is not recommended
