Battle Rules:
 - You gain one Action Point per turn
 - Action points can be used to cast abilities
 - If you cannot move, the enemy goes again and vice versa
 - Having no tokens left is an instant loss
 - If neither player can move, the board gets reset
 - When the board is reset, so is both combatants' AP

For Placing Tokens:
 - You may only place a token on a free cell where that captures enemy tokens
 - Capturing tokens requires you to encase enemy tokens with 2 of your own
       (existing situations do not capture tokens)
 - You can capture tokens in multiple directions with one placement
 - You deal one damage per token captured

For Skills:
 - Each skill has its own requirements to make a move on top of the AP cost
     Betray/Negotiate - Must select an enemy token
     Sacrifice/Heal/Offering - Must select your own token
     Double Strike - Same rules as placing a token
     Rewind - Any spot works
     Void - Must contain at least one enemy or owned token in its 3x3 area
     Dominate - Must select your own token that is lined up with at least one enemy token.
