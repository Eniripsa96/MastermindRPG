Where to obtain:
 - Quests are obtained from NPCs in the
	town
 - Only one or two NPCs will have
	quests each time you stop by

How to complete:
 - To complete the quests, search the
	area described by your quest in
	your quest log from the game menu
	for a 'Q' on the ground. Picking
	these up tell you what you found
	and bringing them back to the NPC
	completes the quest

Rewards:
 - Quests provide you the only source
	of money. If you need to buy items,
	complete some quests
 - A good way to get money is to use
	warp crystals when you have two
	quests available at least 20 areas
	into the game
